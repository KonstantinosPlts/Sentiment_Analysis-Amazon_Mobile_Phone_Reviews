I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE FOUND THIS USED (PHONE TO US & NOT USED HARD AT ALL), PHONE ON LINE FROM SOMEONE WHO UPGRADED AND SOLD THIS ONE. MY SON LIKED HIS OLD ONE THAT FINALLY FELL APART AFTER 2.5+ YEARS AND DIDN'T WANT AN UPGRADE!! THANK YOU SELLER, WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT & YOUR HONESTY RE: SAID USED PHONE.I RECOMMEND THIS SELLER VERY HIGHLY & WOULD BUT FROM THEM AGAIN!!
NICE PHONE, NICE UP GRADE FROM MY PANTACH REVUE. VERY CLEAN SET UP AND EASY SET UP. NEVER HAD AN ANDROID PHONE BUT THEY ARE FANTASTIC TO SAY THE LEAST. PERFECT SIZE FOR SURFING AND SOCIAL MEDIA. GREAT PHONE SAMSUNG
VERY PLEASED
IT WORKS GOOD BUT IT GOES SLOW SOMETIMES BUT ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE I LOVE IT
GREAT PHONE TO REPLACE MY LOST PHONE. THE ONLY THING IS THE VOLUME UP BUTTON DOES NOT WORK, BUT I CAN STILL GO INTO SETTINGS TO ADJUST. OTHER THAN THAT, IT DOES THE JOB UNTIL I AM ELIGIBLE TO UPGRADE MY PHONE AGAIN.THAANKS!
I ALREADY HAD A PHONE WITH PROBLEMS... I KNOW IT STATED IT WAS USED, BUT DANG, IT DID NOT STATE THAT IT DID NOT CHARGE. I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THESE COMMENTS THEN I WOULD HAVE NOT PURCHASED THIS ITEM.... AND ITS CRACKED ON THE SIDE.. DAMAGED GOODS IS WHAT IT IS.... IF TRYING TO CHARGE IT ANOTHER WAY DOES NOT WORK I AM REQUESTING FOR MY MONEY BACK... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....
THE CHARGING PORT WAS LOOSE. I GOT THAT SOLDERED IN. THEN NEEDED A NEW BATTERY AS WELL. $100 LATER (NOT INCLUDING COST OF PURCHASE) I HAVE A USABLE PHONE. THE PHONE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE STATE IT WAS IN.
PHONE LOOKS GOOD BUT WOULDN'T STAY CHARGED, HAD TO BUY NEW BATTERY. STILL COULDN'T STAY CHARGED LONG.SO I TRASHED IT.MONEY LOST, NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM THIS PERSON! !!!
I ORIGINALLY WAS USING THE SAMSUNG S2 GALAXY FOR SPRINT AND WANTED TO RETURN BACK TO THE SAMSUNG EPIC 4G FOR SPRINT BECAUSE I REALLY MISSED THE KEYBOARD, I REALLY LIKED THE SMALLER COMPACT SIZE OF THE PHONE, AND I STILL NEEDED SOME OF THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF A SMART PHONE (I.E. CHECKING E-MAIL, GETTING DIRECTIONS, TEXT MESSAGING) BECAUSE THE PHONE IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS THE NEWER CELL PHONES OUT THERE, JUST BE AWARE THAT THE MORE APPLICATIONS YOU INSTALL THE SLOWER THE PHONE RUNS AND WILL MOST LIKELY FREEZE UP FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT THE CAMERA WORKS GREAT, THE VIDEO IS GREAT AS WELL, AND EVEN THE WEB BROWSING IS DECENT AND GIVES ME WHAT I NEED. I ALSO NOTICE THAT BATTERY LIFE LASTS A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND CHARGING THE PHONE IS MUCH QUICKER THAN MY GALAXY S2.
IT'S BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT. IT'S VERY RESPONSIVE TO TOUCH. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT SOMETIMES THE SCREEN GOES BLACK AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE TOP BUTTON SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE SCREEN TO RE-ILLUMINATE.
MY FIANCE HAD THIS PHONE PREVIOUSLY, BUT CAUSED MANY PROBLEMS. SO, OF COURSE, WE DECIDED TO BROWSE AMAZON FOR A REPLACEMENT TIL' OUR CONTRACT IS UP! & SO FAR SO GOOD!
THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT IT CAME AFTER TWO DAYS OF ORDERING IT. THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE BLEMISH ON THE SIDE,BUT WHO CARES AS LONG AS THE PHONE IS FULLLY FUNCTIONAL.I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE READING THIS.
THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST! I HAD A LITTLE SITUATION WITH MY ITEM BUT THEY QUICKLY FIXED THE ISSUE. I WAS PLEASED AND WILL DEFINITELY BE BUYING ANOTHER PHON FROM THEM IF I NEED ONE.
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT MY PHONE AND SERVICE. THE PHONE WENT OUT ON ME OVER A WEEK AGO. INSTEAD OF HANDLING IT WHEN ISSUE FIRST SURFACED. I'VE BEEN TOLD TO DO THIS AND DO THAT. NOW I'M STICK WITH NO PHONE AND I'M OUT 55 DOLLARS FOR SERVICE THAT I'M NOT USING. I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED A MAILING LABEL TO RETURN ITEM. THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE ON AMAZON. I'M NOT RUSHING TO USE THEIRS OR SMARTPHONES 288 BUSINESS ANYTIME SOON. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A DEAL BUT IT SEEMS LIKE I'M THE ONE WHO LUCKED OUT.
ORDERED THIS PHONE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE SAME MODEL UNTIL MY CONTRACT EXPIRES AND I CAN GET A NEW ONE. SELLER CONFIRMATION SAID DELIVERY COULD TAKE UP TO 7 DAYS. SELLER SENT OUT THE PHONE WITHIN HOURS OF RECEIVING THE ORDER AND I HAD THE PHONE THE NEXT DAY. PHONE LOOKS BETTER THAN DESCRIBED WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER DATA FROM THE OLD ONE TO THE NEW ONE WITH NO PROBLEMS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER
HAD THIS PHONE BEFORE AND LOVED IT BUT WAS NOT WORKING SO I GOT THIS PHONE. ONE THING IS THE SD CARD SLOT DOES NOT OPEN UP WHEN I TRY TO ACCESS IT IN FILE MANAGMENT, EVEN DOES NOT SHOW UP ON THE COMPUTER. THE CARD IS FINE WAS ABLE TO OPEN ON ANOTHER PHONE. TRYING TO TROUBLE SHOOT IT FOR NOW.
I WAS ABLE TO GET THE PHONE I PREVIOUSLY OWNED...WITH A KEYBOARD AND TOUCH SCREEN. IT'S THE BEST PHONE AND I LOVE IT. I STILL HAD TO CLEAN THE DEVICE WITH MY SERVICE PROVIDER, BUT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT.
I BROUGHT THIS PHONE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR MY DAUGHTER, WHO IS VERY HARD ON CELL PHONES. I MUST SAY IT WAS A GREAT PURCHASE. THE PHONE WORK WONDERFUL. THANK YOU
I LOVE THE PHONE. IT DOES EVERYTHING I NEED AND WORKS GREAT. I PURCHASED FOUR OF THESE PHONES THROUGH A SELLER THAT SHIPPED FROM AMAZON'S WAREHOUSE. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE PHONE DIDN'T COME WITH A MICRO SD CARD. I COULDN'T USE THE CAMERA UNTIL I GOT THE CARD. NO PROBLEMS GETTING THESE ACTIVATED AT SPRINT.
UNFORTUNATELY SPRINT COULD NOT ACTIVATE THE PHONE DUE TO THE BLOCKING ISSUE WITH THE PHONE, THE MATTER WAS HANDLED VERY WELL AND QUICKLY. VERY SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE.
THE BATTERY WAS OLD & HAD BEEN OVER USED BECAUSE IT BARELY HOLDS A CHARGE. OTHERWISE, NO ISSUES WITH THE PHONE ITSELF.
PROS-BEAUTIFUL SCREEN,CAPABLE OF RUNNING CHROME,TAKE GOOD PICTURES,THE KEYBOARD IS COMFY,FITS IN MY POCKET AND FIT MY HANDS,PLAYS REALLY GOOD VIDEOS AND GAMESCONS-NO BLUETOOTH,CAME LATE,RUN DOWN FAST REALLY QUICK,DOESNT PLAY 1080P VIDEOS.BUT I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO LIKE TO TALK AND TEXT A LOT LIKE ME AND WATCH A LOT OF MOVIES
I PURCHASED THIS PHONE IN DECEMBER AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO MY SON. I CALLED SPRINT TO ACTIVATE THE PHONE ONLY TO FIND OUT THE ESN WASN'T CLEAR. I WAS TOLD TO COME INTO THE STORE AND UPON RESEARCH THE PHONE WASN'T CLEAR. I REACHED OUT TO THIS COMPANY TO INFORM THEM THAT THIS ESN WASN'T CLEAN. I WAS TOLD TO SEND THE PHONE BACK AND THEY WOULD SEND OUT ANOTHER PHONE. I ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE ESN # SO THAT I COULD CALL AND MAKE SURE IT WAS CLEAR. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PHONE AVAILABLE AND WAS GUARANTEED IT WOULD BE CLEAR. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN SOMETHING WAS WRONG THEN. I RECEIVED A SECOND PHONE THAT TURNED OUT NOT HAVE A CLEAR ESN. THE REPRESENTATIVE AT SPRINT INFORMED ME THAT THE SELLER OF THESE PHONES ARE AWARE THE THE ESN ISN'T CLEAR. SO ONCE AGAIN I HAD TO SEND ANOTHER PHONE BACK. I ASKED FOR A REFUND FOR THE PHONE AND SHIPPING SINCE THE SENT ME TWO PHONES THAT DIDN'T HAVE A CLEAR ESN. I RECEIVED MY REFUND FOR THE PHONE BUT HAVE YET TO SEE A REFUND FOR THE SHIPPING. I WOULDN'T SUGGEST YOU BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.
PHONE GOOD JUST A LITTLE SLOW PHONE OLD BUT IT'S A GREAT PHONE TEMPORARY RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DEAL
PHONE'S SPEAKER LITTLE LOW. OVERALL VERY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE. I WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER CELL PHONE FROM CHUBBIETECH. I AM SATISFIED.
THE PHONE WAS GREAT AND IN GOOD CONDITION. MY DAUGHTER IS SO HAPPY THE BE A ANDRIOD USER NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE REASONS FOR THE 3 STAR RATING WAS IT WAS IN MY OPINION BETTER THAN MY IPHONE 4S BUT IT TENDS TO RANDOMLY CRASH, AND RANDOMLY POWER OFF BUT IT IS GOOD FOR STORAGE SPACE, BATTERY USAGE, AND CAMERA
PHONE WORKS GREAT. NO PROBLEMS AT ALL
WAS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION BUT DOES WORK GOOD
JUST... NOT GOOD. THE PHONE HAS GREAT SCREEN RESOLUTION, STORAGE IS LOW, YOU NEED AN SD CARD TO DO ANYTHING. MAY HAVE A CLEAR ESN BUT DON'T EXPECT TO USE IT WITH THINGS LIKE FREEDOMPOP.
AS DESCRIBED, FAST SHIP!
PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.
ONE OF THE PHONES HAVE A BAD CHARGER PORT. I WANT TO SEND IT BACK
JUST GOT THIS PHONE AND IT IS A GREAT PHONE. IT'S EASY TO USE.
THE PHONE WAS GREAT BUT IT HAD GOTTEN OLD SO IT WAS TIME FOR A REPLACEMENT.IT WAS GREAT WHILE IT LASTED.
THIS PHONE CAME IN GREAT CONDITION! GREAT PRICE AND IT BRINGS BACK GREAT MEMORIES OF OWNING THIS PHONE!
MET ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. I CAN'T COMPLAIN AT ALL. GREAT PRICE!
PHONE IS WORKING ON, I WAS PLANNING TO USE IT FOR WHATSAPP ANYWAY. THE OH PROBLEM, I CAN'T CHANGE THE IDIOM
EXCELLENT PRODUCT IN PERFECT CONDITION
EXCELLENT
EXCELENTE

I LIKE THESE PHONE I BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOM AND SHE LOVES IT
IT CAME WITH ARABIAN KEYBOARD :(
I LOVE THE PHONE, BUT ONE PROBLEM AND ONE PROBLEM ONLY............ONCE THE MIC GOES THAT'S IT. NO MORE MIC. BUT IT CAN TAKE A BEATING.
I LOVE IT!
VERY PRACTICAL AND USER-FRIENDLY PHONE. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT.
SHARP AND CLASSY PHONE
VERY GOOD
100% GOODDD!
SHIPPED QUICKLY AND WAS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED!
WORKS WONDERFUL FOR THE PRICE!
BOUGHT THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A SMART PHONE AND DATA PLAN. I USE IT WITH GO-PHONE ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO PLAN. THE PHONE FUNCTIONS ARE GREAT. THE RADIO AND MUSIC PLAYERS ARE VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY. THE SMART PHONE TYPE FEATURES ARE EASIER AND FASTER TO USE THAN ANY SMART PHONE I HAVE USED. THERE ARE SOME SOFTWARE GLITCHES THAT ARE DOCUMENTED ON THE NOKIA SUPPORT SITE WHICH PROVED EASILY FIXED. EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE NOKIA BASED FEATURES ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT, YOU CAN STILL USE THE FEATURES NEEDED BY ACCESSING THE WEB DIRECTLY VIA WIFI CONNECTION - OR DATA IF YOU WANT TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE - AND LAUNCHING THE SITE/APPLICATION FROM THERE. ALTHOUGH THE NEW NOKIA BROWSER IS PRETTY SPARTAN IN APPEARANCE, IT IS FAST AND RUNS WITH GOOD STABILITY. I AM A VERY BIG GUY WITH LANDS LARGE EVEN FOR MY SIZE AND I FIND THE FULL QWERTY KEYBOARD TO BE PRETTY EASY TO USE. I LIKE THE PROGRAMMABLE HOT KEYS AND ON-SCREEN SHORTCUTS. KEEPS YOU FROM LAUNCHING ITEMS THAT REQUIRE DATA CONNECTIONS BY ACCIDENT. THE BACK LIGHTING IS THOROUGH AND EVEN AND THE RAISED BUTTONS ARE TACTILE WITH A POSITIVE CLICK RESPONSE. THE PHONE DOES HAVE A FEW QUIRKS. THERE IS NO AIRPLANE MODE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. THE FLIGHT PROFILE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO BE SET WITH THE BROADCASTING AND RECEIVING FUNCTIONS TURNED OFF. THE MAIN NAVIGATION BUTTON/MOUSE IS A LITTLE SMALL AND DOESN'T ALWAYS RESPOND AS EXPECTED - THAT MIGHT BE ME THOUGH. ALL IN ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE AND VENDOR HIGHLY IF YOU WANT THE FEATURES OF A SMART PHONE BUT YOU DON'T NEED GPS OR A BIG DATA BILL EVERY MONTH FOR A BUNCH OF THINGS YOU DON'T NEED OR WANT TO KEEP YOU LIFE RUNNING SMOOTHLY.
MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
THIS PHONE IS TRAPPED IN 2001, IF YOU WANT A SIMPLE PHONE GET AN OLD SCHOOL FLIP PHONE. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING ALSO FOR WORK GET A BLACKBERRY OR SOMTHING NEW. THIS ISN'T EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE TWO, IT'S IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. NOTHING BUT FRUSTRATION WITH THIS PHONE.
EXCELLENT
A FRIEND MENTIONED THIS PHONE TO ME AND IT WORTH WHAT HE SAID. THANKS A LOT MY FRIEND.
USED THIS UNLOCKED GSM NOKIA ASHA 302 IN THE PHILIPPINES JUST RECENTLY (JAN-FEB 2015). EXCELLENT, NO PROBLEM WITH FUNCTIONALITY. BOUGHT A P40 SIM CARD AT THE AIRPORT & PRESTO! IT WORKED. I PASSED IT ON TO MY BROTHER THE INSTANT I CAME BACK TO THE US. HE WILL BE VISITING THE PHILIPPINES SOON. IT WAS VERY EASY TO USE. HAVING BEEN USED TO SMART PHONES W/ TOUCH SCREEN, I SURPRISED MYSELF WHEN I WORKED W/ IT EASILY NOT HAVING READ THE INSTRUCTIONS TO OPERATE IT. I'LL BUY ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS & DEFINITELY AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THIS NOKIA UNLOCKED GSM PHONE.
EXCELENTE
EXCELLENT PHONE FOR MY YOUNGEST SON, WITH WALK IN REASONABLE OPTIONS, AND QUALITY FIRST
EXCELENTE

PERFECT, PRACTICAL, EASY TO HANDLE, GOOD RESOLUTION, WELL PACKED
EXCELLENT PRODUCT !!....ALL RIGHT....I RECOMMEND....

NOKIA IS THE BRAND THAT CAN BE USED IN TELEPHONE, GOOD PRICE, EXCELLENT TEAM, WAS A GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LIKED IT, EASY TO USE AND VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE, I RECOMMEND IT.
FIRST OFF, LET ME SAY I'VE BEEN A NOKIA USER SINCE I HAD MY FIRST CELL PHONE AT AGE 16, TEN YEARS AGO. OF COURSE THERE WAS THAT ONE YEAR WHERE I VENTURED OFF INTO SAMSUNG LAND BUT THAT PHONE DIED AND BACK TO NOKIA I WENT. BUT I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED NOKIA PHONES.SECOND, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A QWERTY PHONE WITH INTERNET/VIDEO/MP3 PLAYING CAPABILITIES AND THE ASHA 302 FITS IT. IT IS A STRONG BUILD, AS I HAVE DROPPED IT NUMEROUS TIMES AND THE PHONE IS STILL INTACT. I LIKE THE KEYBOARD AS I AM NOT A FAN OF TOUCHSCREENS AT ALL (WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T GET THE ASHA 303). AS FAR AS SOUND I THINK IT DEPENDS ON YOUR HEADPHONES. I HAD EARBUDS THAT PRODUCED A LOUDNESS OF 93 DECIBELS WHICH MADE THE LISTENING EXPERIENCE MEDIOCRE BUT THEN I BOUGHT BUDS WITH A 110 DB LOUDNESS AND THE SOUND IS MUCH BETTER. NOKIA XPRESS IS A BIT SUCKY BUT I DOWNLOADED AN OPERA BROWSER FOR THE PHONE AND IT WORKS SLIGHTLY BETTER SO INTERNET EXPERIENCE IS PRETTY EASY. I WON'T GET INTO VIDEO GAMES AND SNS BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN DO THAT ON MY PC SO I DON'T HAVE A REASON TO USE IT ON MY PHONE.MY ONLY WISH IS THAT THE 302 HAD A BUILT IN ANTENNA SO I COULD LISTEN TO RE RADIO WITHOUT RDS EARBUDS. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A REALLY GREAT PHONE AND FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO MOVE UP INTO BLACKBERRYS BUT DON'T WANT TO PAY SO MUCH THE NOKIA ASHA 302 IS A GREAT PHONE TO START WITH.EDIT (OCTOBER 3, 2013): I FOUND A GINO 25CM 4 SECTION TELESCOPING STAINLESS STEEL AM FM RADIO ANTENNA 3.5MM PLUG TO USE FOR PLAYING THE RADIO THROUGH THE SPEAKER. SO NOW I'M REALLY ENJOYING THE PHONE FOR WHEN I'M SITTING OUTSIDE WITH FRIENDS OR AT MY DESK.
NOKIA ASHA 302 UNLOCKED GSM PHONE WITH 3.2MP CAMERA, VIDEO, QWERTYDEPENDABLETRADITIONAL NOKIA MENU'SNOT COMPLICATED LIKE 'SMART PHONES'DURABLEEASY TO USE ON STRAIGHTTALK, INTERNET, WIFI, BLUETOOTH.
"THIS IS A SOLIDLY-BUILT UNLOCKED PHONE THAT IS AN UPDATE TO THE POPULAR NOKIA C3. IT RUNS THE S40 SOFTWARE WHICH HAS ITS GOODS AND BADS. IT HAS GOOD RECEPTION AND NICE AUDIO. THE 3G SUPPORTS 850 AND 1900 BANDS (AT&T AND T-MOBILE WHEN IT'S HSPA IS REFARMED FROM 1700/2100 TO THE 1900 PCS BAND.) + THE 2100 BAND.THE KEYBOARD IS PRETTY GOOD, NOT AS FIRM AS OTHER NOKIA QWERTY PHONES (E.G. E5), BUT COMPARABLE TO THE C3 KEYBOARD. THE ONE THAT I HAVE IS OBVIOUSLY FOR THE WORLD MARKET, SINCE IT HAS SOME ADDED EUROPEAN CHARS AND SYMBOLS ON THE KEYPAD. WI-FI WORKS FINE, AND OPERA MINI INSTALLED AND RUNS WITHOUT PROBLEMS - GOOD WAY TO GO FOR A BIT OF WEB-SURFING. I DID NOT TRIED ANY OF THE E-MAIL OR SOCIAL CLIENTS. TEXT MESSAGING CAN BE SET TO 'NORMAL' IN-BOX OR CONVERSATION MODES. OVI STORE APP DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK THAT WELL. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FEATURES THAT I FOUND APPEALING: ABILITY TO BACKUP THE PHONE MEMORY TO THE SD CARD; ABILITY TO LOCK THE KEYPAD WITH A PASSCODE EITHER MANUALLY OR AUTOMATICALLY AFTER A SET TIME. THE BATTERY IS FAIRLY GOOD SIZED (BL-5J). THE 'FUNCTION' KEYS AND THE D-PAD KEYS CAN ALL BE RE-ASSIGNED TO USER DEFINED SHORT-CUTS. MY OPINION: IT IS A WORTHY UPDATE (3G) TO THE C3, NOT QUITE IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE E5 WHICH HAS THE MULTI-TASKING S60 SOFTWARE. FOR THE PRICE OF AROUND $110, IT IS AN UNLOCKED FEATURE (GSM/3G) PHONE WELL WORTH CONSIDERING, AS LONG AS ONE KNOWS THAT ONE IS GETTING A NON-SMART PHONE AND THAT APPS FOR S40 IS VERY LIMITED."
HOLA, COMPRAMOS DOS TELÉFONOS Y VIENIERON TOTALENTE DIFERENTES, UNO VINO CON LA BATERÍA DAÑADA, SE DESCARGA DE INMEDIATO. EL OTRO TELÉFONO VINO SIN LA TARJETA DE MEMORIA Y LOS TECLADOS Y CARGADORES SON MUY DISTINTOS.MI TÍA Y YO NOS SENTIMOS ENGAÑADAS Y DEFRAUDADAS :(
THIS CELLPHONE IS VERY EASY FOR USING, IT HAS COMPLETE APPS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ARE INCORPORATED AND I JUST HAD TO USE IT WITH WI FI CONNECTION, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED IT IS A SIMPLE PHONE BUT COMPLETE AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT...
GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE..
FREEZES ALOT. BUT I BOUGHT PRIMARILY FOR PLAYING BACK MY MUSIC INSTEAD OF MY BB. ITS A GREAT PHONE FOR SMS AND RINGS REALLY LOUD. THE BODY IS STRONG AND NEAT
THE KEYS ARE A LITTLE HARD TO HIT, AND I DIDN'T EXPECT A SPANISH KEYBOARD. BUT OVERALL, A VERY GOOD PHONE.
"PREFACE: THIS IS NOT WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A SMARTPHONE IN THE UNITED STATES (NOTHING ON THE PAR OF ANDROID, IPHONE, OR WINDOWS PHONE), IT IS BASICALLY A FEATURE PHONE. ALSO, ALTHOUGH IT SAYS HERE THAT IT HAS A US WARRANTY ALL OF THE WARRANTY MATERIAL IT CAME WITH REFERENCED LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES SO I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS REALLY COVERED UNDER A US WARRANTY. I RETURNED IT DURING AMAZON'S RETURN WINDOW SO IT WASN'T AN ISSUE. NOW FOR THE PHONE REVIEW.PROS: THE PHONE HAS A GREAT KEYBOARD. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE E-SERIES PHONES ITS THAT TYPE OF KEYBOARD. THE INTERFACE IS SOME SORT OF MODIFIED SYMBIAN AND I LIKED IT IN A LOT OF WAYS. THE STYLE OF THE HARDWARE IS ATTRACTIVE AND THE GRAY IS A NICE COLOR. THE CAMERA WAS PRETTY DECENT CONSIDERING IT IS ONLY 2 MEGAPIXELS. FOR E-MAIL IT'S ADEQUATE.CONS: I'LL START WITH THE SMALL ISSUES AND WORK UP TO THE BIG PROBLEM THAT ULTIMATELY MADE ME DECIDE TO RETURN THE PHONE. THE ONBOARD SOCIAL NETWORK APPS ARE NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL. YOU CAN UPDATE YOUR FACEBOOK OR TWITTER STATUS BUT THE REST OF IT IS SO-SO. THE OVI STORE IN GENERAL IS A POOR APP STORE, BUT THIS PHONE ISN'T ABLE TO USE MANY OF THEM. EVEN THE OLD FACEBOOK APP THAT I USED ON MY OLD E71 (IT USED TO BE CALLED SNAPTU BUT FACEBOOK HAS SINCE RENAMED IT TO FACEBOOK FOR EVERYONE) IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THIS PHONE AS ARE MOST OF THE BETTER APPS IN THE OVI STORE. THE BROWSER WAS MEDIOCRE, BARELY PASSABLE. ALSO, NO GPS FOR THIS PHONE. NOKIA/OVI MAPS IS INCOMPATIBLE WHICH IS TOO BAD BECAUSE THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NOKIA STRENGTH. THAT IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATES THIS PHONE AS A SMART PHONE. WITH ALL OF THAT SAID, I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY WIFE AND SHE REALLY ONLY NEEDED A PHONE FOR TEXTS AND CALLS SO WE COULD HAVE OVERLOOKED THESE THINGS. THE PROBLEM WE COULD NOT OVERLOOK WAS THE VERY SHABBY, FLIMSY PIECE OF METAL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HOLD IN PLACE THE STANDARD SIM CARD. THIS LITTLE PIECE OF METAL WAS BARELY ATTACHED TO THE PHONE AND WOULD NOT LOCK INTO PLACE TO HOLD DOWN THE SIM CARD. BECAUSE THE SIM CARD WOULD INTERMITTENTLY GET LOSE INSIDE THE PHONE AND CONSTANTLY LOSE THE SIGNAL. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT AND RE-ADJUST THE SIM CARD. THEN IT WOULD WORK FOR A LITTLE WHILE ONLY TO ULTIMATELY HAVE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS. IT WAS WAY MORE FRUSTRATION THAN IT WAS WORTH. IT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE AS A BASIC PHONE FOR CALLS, TEXTS, E-MAIL, AND OCCASIONALLY UPDATING YOUR FACEBOOK/TWITTER STATUS; THIS PHONE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL. BECUASE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE SIM CARD HOLDER, HOWEVER, IT WAS ESSENTIALLY UNUSABLE. I HAVE USED NOKIA PHONES FOR YEARS (I USE A LUMIA 710 PERSONALLY) AND I AM REALLY SURPRISED NOKIA WOULD DO SUCH A SLOPPY JOB ON SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS THE PART THAT HOLDS THE SIM CARD IN PLACE. WHAT A WASTE."
WE JUST RECEIVED THE PHONE A FEW DAYS AGO. PUT IN THE CONSUMER CELLULAR SIM CARD, AND IT IS READY TO GO. THE PHONE SEEMS VERY NICE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NOT COME CLOSE TO DISCOVERING ALL OF THE THINGS IT WILL DO. IT HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF RING TONES BUILT IN.
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING A BIT MORE ADVANCED THAN THE NOKIA C2 I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON IN 2012, BUT DIDN'T WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY WITH A SMARTPHONE. IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD FEATURE PHONE WITH SMARTPHONE FEATURES WITHOUT THE TOUCH SCREEN. RED, HOWEVER, IS MY FAVORITE COLOR, BUT I WENT FOR THE WHITE ONE BECAUSE MY C2 IS SILVER AND I COULDN'T FIND A SILVER ASHA 302 ON AMAZON. I'VE HAD IT FOR A WEEK AND IT WORKS GREAT. BEST IS THE WI-FI FEATURE, WHICH GIVES YOU ACCESS TO THE WEB WITHOUT PURCHASING A DATA PLAN (WHICH I MAY HAVE TO DO IF I WANT TO ACCESS PERSONAL EMAIL OR GO ON FACEBOOK). IT HAS THE GREAT CALENDAR, ALARM CLOCK, TEXT MESSAGING, CAMERA, MISSED/RECEIVED CALL AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE C2, WHICH MAKES IT A KEEPER. AND IT'S A LITTLE BIGGER, WITH A WIDER SCREEN, BUT NOT SO BIG IT CAN'T FIT INTO MY POCKET OR PURSE. I CAN USE THE SAME NOKIA CHARGER I HAD FOR THE C2. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF MY PURPLE PHONE SKIN, THEN I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. I'VE HAD NOKIA PHONES SINCE 1999 AND THEY'VE NEVER LET ME DOWN - JUST GET BETTER!
THE PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD. I AM USING IT WITH A LYCAMOBILE PLAN. ONLY THING THAT IS AWKWARD IS THAT THE BOTTOM ROW OF LETTERS IS OFF COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES AND DEVICES. BEFORE THIS I HAD BEEN USING A BLACKBERRY. WHEN TRYING TO TYPE ON THE NOKIA I AM ALWAYS MISTYPING MS, NS AND ESPECTIALLY THE SHIFT KEY (WHICH YOU NEED TO HIT TO INSERT ANY PUNCTUATION)
LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. ALSO IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER TOUCH PHONE BUT IS NOT. WHICH MAKES IT STYLISH YET CLASSIC.
THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED. YOUR PRICE IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT RECEIVE.RECOMMEND IT
THIS PHONE IN AN EXCELLENT PHONE AT A GREAT PRICE. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE FEATURES OF THIS PHONE AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
HAVE PROBLEMS SETTING CORRECT TIME ON NOKIA ASHA 302. CUSTOMER SUPPORT ON NOKIA.COM DOES NOT ACCEPT INQUIRY ABOUT ASHA 302 PHONES. IS THIS PRODUCT OBSOLETE, OR IS NOKIA CUSTOMER SUPPORT POOR? BOOKLET THAT CAME WITH PHONE IS ALSO POORLY WRITTEN.
THIS IS A GOOD PHONE ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO HAVE A SMALL SCREEN. HOWEVER, IT'S CAPABLE OF PERFORMING ALL THE BASIC FUNCTIONS SUCH AS CALLING, MESSAGING, WEB BROWSING, SOCIAL NETWORKING AND IT ALSO HAS A WI-FI CAPABILITY.
I'VE BEEN A LONG TIME USER OF THE IPHONE. I FINALLY GOT SICK OF IT AND SOLD IT. I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE PHONE. AFTER GOING THROUGH ABOUT 3 OF THEM, THIS FITS THE BILL VERY WELL. THE TEXTING INTERFACE IS VERY NICE AND INTUITIVE. THE BATTERY LIFE IS STELLAR. IT CONNECTS TO THE INTERNET JUST FINE. I CAN CHECK MY EMAIL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, LOOK UP DIRECTIONS, ETC. BASICALLY EVERYTHING I WAS ABLE TO DO WITH MY SMARTPHONE, WITHOUT THE BELLS AND WHISTLES. HAVING A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD IS QUITE NICE TOO. THE OS SEEMS VERY STABLE AND SNAPPY. YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE CALENDAR, TODO, MEMOS, ETC.BACKUP IS A SNAP. JUST INSERT AN SD CARD AND GO TO SETTINGS TO BACK IT UP. NO MORE ITUNES! IF YOU WANT TO ADD MUSIC OR PODCASTS, JUST PLUG IT INTO THE COMPUTER, COPY PASTE TO THE SD CARD AND YOU'RE DONE.I WOULD BUY THIS PHONE AGAIN DEFINITELY IF I BROKE OR LOST IT.
"THIS PHONE, LIKE ALL OF NOKIA'S FEATURE PHONES, ARE GREAT FOR THEIR VALUE AND DURABILITY. THE LAST PHONE I HAD BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE WAS A NOKIA C-3, WHICH WAS ALSO A GREAT PHONE. IT LASTED FOR YEARS, AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE KEPT GOING IF I HADN'T ACCIDENTALLY JUMPED INTO A POOL WITH IT IN MY POCKET :P THIS PHONE IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE C-3. IT IS SLEEK AND SMALL, HAS A FULL QWERTY KEYBOARD, AND HAS WI-FI INTERNET BROWSING. THIS IS THE BEST PHONE YOU CAN GET IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FUNCTIONALITY, BUT DON'T WANT TO THROW HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AT A SMARTPHONE WITH A DATA PLAN.AND THE BUYER SHOULD BE AWARE; THIS IS NOT A SMARTPHONE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING LIKE A SMARTPHONE, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TOY YOU CAN TAKE OUT OF YOUR POCKET EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TINKER AROUND WITH, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. YES, IT DOES HAVE AN INTERNET BROWSER WHICH WORKS WELL, BUT THE SCREEN IS QUITE SMALL SO IT'S NOT GOOD FOR RECREATIONAL BROWSING. I JUST USE IT TO LOOK THINGS UP, IT WORKS FINE FOR THAT. IT ALSO HAS SOME SOCIAL NETWORK APPS, BUT I DON'T USE THEM. I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL THEY WORK, BUT IF THAT'S A PRIORITY FOR YOU THIS PHONE PROBABLY ISN'T THE BEST CHOICE. SAME GOES FOR THE CAMERA; I DON'T USE IT, CAN'T SPEAK TO ITS QUALITY, BUT IF A CAMERA IS IMPORTANT TO YOU THIS ISN'T THE BEST CHOICE.THE ONLY OTHER POTENTIAL NEGATIVE I CAN SEE IN THIS PHONE IS THAT THE KEYS REALLY ARE PRETTY SMALL. I HAVEN'T HAD AN ISSUE WITH THEM PERSONALLY, BUT IF SOMEONE HAS BIG HANDS I SEE HOW THIS COULD BE ANNOYING.I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR THE ADVANTAGES TO NOT OWNING A SMARTPHONE: LONGER BATTERY LIFE, HIGHER DURABILITY, LOWER COST, BUT STILL GOOD AT ACCOMPLISHING WHAT IT NEEDS TO. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING, NOKIA IS DEFINITELY THE BEST WAY TO GO."
LOVE IT.
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG TO REPLY OR REVIEW THIS PURCHASE AS IT OVER 18 MONTHS.THIS PHONE WAS A CLONE PHONE FROM HONG KONG--THE QUALITY IS FAIR--ALL THE SYMBOLS DON'T MATCH--SUCH AS \ ? !--BUT THE PHONE WORKS I THINK AMAZON SHOULD BOYCOTT THIS SELLER.
BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY MUM AND SHE LOVES IT. IT IS A STRONG DURABLE PHONE, HAS GOOD RECEPTION AND IT FUNCTIONS WELL.
INCREDIBLE! THIS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE SPLANIISH LANGUAGE, I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW CAN IT BE A INTERNATIONAL VERSION, LOST MONEY!
BAD
GOOD
THE BATTERY DIED IN LESS THAN 24/HOURS....
EXCELLENT PRODUCT.
VERY WELL
CANNOT CONNECT TO GSM NETWORK
THIS CELL PHONE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS, IT'S USER FRIENDLY & EVERYTHING WORKS LIKE THEY SAID IT WOULD. THE PRICE IS AMAZINGLY CHEAP. THE FEATURES ARE ENORMOUS & HELPFUL.
PROS.. IT WORKS FINE, ITS EASY TO USE, NOT TOO HEAVY.CONS .. MOST OF THE APPS ARE FOR ANDROID IPHONE AND BB
I WENT THROUGH LOTS OF REVIEWS FOR DIFFERENT PHONE BEFORE BUYING IT. I FOUND THIS PHONE PRETTY GOOD. NO PROBLEMS SO FAR.
EXCELENTE
I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS A OK PHONE. I DON'T LIKE THE KEYBOARD. THERE IS ONLY 5 OR 6 LANGUAGE OPTIONS, NO KOREAN AND CHINESE.
EXCELENTE
PHONE WORKS GREAT, LOOKS GREAT AND SHIPPED QUIET QUICKLY ONLY ISSUE IS CAN WITH A EUROPEAN CHARGER SO HAD TO PURCHASE MICRO-USB TO USB CABLE TO CHARGE PHONE WHICH I WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO TO DOWNLOAD AND UPDATE SYSTEM ANY WAY.
VER GOOD!
"A PRETTY CAPABLE, DURABLE TEXTING PHONE, UNLOCKED AS ADVERTISED, BUT THE VERSION I RECEIVED HAD ARABIC ON THE KEYS IN ADDITION TO THE TYPICAL ISO BASIC LATIN AND MANY SYMBOLS MISSING, LIKE ""!""."
EXCELLENT PHONE HAS ALL THE SPECIAL FUNCTIONS TO BE COMMUNICATED WITH ALL SOCIAL NETWORKS, EXCELLENT OPERATIONAL...I RECOMMEND IT 100% EXCELLENT PRODUCT
DO NOT BUY IT!. IT FEELS LIKE A PRETENDED TOY IN YOUR HAND. IF YOU WANT IT FOR YOUR KIDS, IT'S OK!.
EXCELLENT PHONE, FOR ADULTS RECOMMEND. . WHATSAPP, INTERNET , APP, RADIO, KEYBOARD QWERTY EASY FOR USE. DISPLAY BIG VISUALISER. FUNNY
I HAVE ENJOYED MY NOKIA C3 PHONE FOR A FEW YEARS, BUT IT WAS TIRED AND NEEDED AN UPDATE. THIS ASHA 302 PHONE IS JUST THAT - ALL OF THE SYMBIAN S40 SIMPLE GOODNESS, WITH A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY SET OF HARDWARE. THE SCREEN IS SHARPER, PROCESSOR FASTER, PHONE TAKES NICE CLEAR PICTURES THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH GOOD ENOUGH, THE RING AND ALERT TONES ARE MORE DISCREET AND PROFESSIONAL. THE INTERNET AND MAIL STUFF IS ACTUALLY USEABLE ON T-MOBILE'S 3.5G NETWORK AND REQUIRES VERY LITTLE DATA TO STAY CONNECTED ON A MINUMAL PLAN. STRANGELY, I CANNOT IT DO WIFI YET ... IT RECEIVES THE SIGNAL BUT JUST INSISTS ON USING NETWORK DATA OR NOTHING AT ALL. PROBABLY A SETTING IN THE MENU I HAVE NOT TOGGLED TO THE RIGHT SETTING. ANYWAY - IF YOU WANT A PHONE THAT TEXTS VERY EASILY, HAS A 4-DAY BATTERY, A VERY CONVENIENT AND USEABLE FEATURES, AND YET NOT CRACK OPEN THE CRACK-PIPE OF THE INTERNET CONSTANLY, THE ASHA 302 DOES IT WITH STYLE AND THEN SOME. I MAY GET MYSELF ANOTHER ONE OR TWO FOR THE FUTURE, AS I BET THIS IS THE END-RUN FOR THIS TYPE OF PRACTICAL PHONE.
WHEN I GOT PHONE IT WOULDN'T WORK I TOOK IT TO A VERIZON STORE HERE THE BATTERY DIDN'T WORK EVEN WHEN I CHARGED IT FOR 12 HRS VERIZON PUT ANOTHER USED BATTERY IN PHONE IT STARTED TO WORK
I LIKED
GREAT. ARRIVED QUICKLY.
PHONE WORKS GREAT, YOU MAY HAVE TO GET A SUM CARD ADAPTER TO MAKE MICRO SIM CATS WORK.
AVIANNA LLC IS AN INCREDIBLE SELLER. THE PHONE DID TAKE A WHILE TO GET TO MY PLACE HOWEVER WHEN THE PHONE DIDN'T WORK ON MY PROVIDER, ANDREW STAYED ON THE PHONE WITH ME WITH TECH SUPPORT WITH MY SERVICE PROVIDER FOR OVER 1.5 HRS JUST TO TRY AND GET THE PHONE TO WORK. WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A REPLACEMENT PHONE FOR ME TO USE. HE IS VERY RECEPTIVE TO FEEDBACK AND IS CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT WHEN A PROBLEM ARISES. THE PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED, USED SPRINT UNLOCKED BLACKBERRY BOLD AND I BELIEVE IT IS THE SERVICE FROM MY PROVIDER THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.
AD ADVERTISED AS UNLOCKED, HAD TO PAY $30..00 TO HAVE UNLOCKED, PHONE NUMBER DOES NOT APPEAR ON PHONE.
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.THANK YOU.
GOT IT FASTER THAN I EXPECTED. JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY JOB THANKS A LOT
EXELENTE
PHONE WORKS GREAT FOR THE PRICE ALTHOUGH WHEN WE GOT IT BY UPS THE UPS GUY JUST DROPPED IT BETWEEN THE SCREEN DOOR AND OUR BIG DOOR
"KEEPING IN MIND THAT THIS IS A SUB $100 PHONE THAT HAS GENERALLY BEEN ADVERTISED AS THE ""CHEAPEST QUAD-CORE PHONE,"" THE LANDVO L800 HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD PHONE THAT HAS EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. FROM ALL MY RESEARCH, LANDVO SEEMS TO BE A NEW COMPANY AND THE L800 WAS THEIR FIRST MODEL WHICH THEY RELEASED IN MARCH OF 2014. I TOOK A RISK (ALTHOUGH LESS THAN $100 ISN'T A HUGE RISK) IN BUYING THIS IN APRIL WITH NO REVIEWS AVAILABLE. THE MAIN THING I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS THE MOST POWERFUL, INEXPENSIVE PHONE AT THE $100 PRICE POINT. BATTERY LIFE WAS ALSO A MAJOR FACTOR. SO I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ON THE BASIS OF BEING THE ONLY PHONE IN THE PRICE RANGE AT THE TIME WITH A QUADCORE PROCESSOR AND ALSO BECAUSE IT SPORTS A 2300MAH BATTERY WHICH WAS ABOUT THE LARGEST BATTERY AT THE PRICE POINT OF THE AVAILABLE MODELS.THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS I IMMEDIATELY LIKED ABOUT THE PHONE. DESPITE THE LOW RESOLUTION AND LACK OF IPS, THE SCREEN IS PRETTY CRISP AND THE VIEWING ANGLES ARE MORE THAN DECENT. THE BATTERY LIFE HAS ALSO BEEN GOOD--AS I HAVE BEEN AVERAGING TWO DAYS OF AVERAGE USE ON A FULL CHARGE. ONE DAY OF HEAVY USE WOULD USUALLY PUT ME AROUND THE 30% RANGE WHICH STILL ISN'T BAD. I ALSO WAS ALMOST SHOCKED BY THE BUILD QUALITY. THE PHONE IS HEAVIER THAN MOST NAME-BRAND COMPETITION IN ITS SIZE CLASS BUT IT HAS A WEIGHTY, SOLID FEEL TOO IT. THE SIDES ARE METAL, AS ARE THE VOLUME ROCKER AND POWER BUTTON. THERE ARE NO CREAKS AND EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER TIGHTLY. FIT AND FINISH IS TOP NOTCH. I BELIEVE THE SCREEN IS PLASTIC AND NOT GLASS, HOWEVER. THEIR ARE PROS AND CONS TO THIS AS A PLASTIC SCREEN IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SCRATCHING. HOWEVER, IT DOES MEAN THAT I WILL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A CRACKED SCREEN IF I DROP THE PHONE. THE PHONE CAME WITH A SCREEN PROTECTOR PREFITTED ON THE PHONE AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE IN THE BOX. THE INCLUDED SILICONE CASE IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE BUT WAS ALSO A NICE TOUCH, ESPECIALLY OWING TO THE FACT THAT A NO-NAME BRAND PHONE IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE THIRD PARTY SUPPORT FOR CASES AND SUCH.HOWEVER, I WOULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS PHONE TO ANYONE AT THE TIME. WHY? BECAUSE PERFORMANCE WAS LACKLUSTER. THE QUADCORE SOC IS QUITE SNAPPY HOWEVER, THE SMALL 512MB OF RAM WAS SUFFERING ON ANDROID 4.2.2. I WAS WARY OF PURCHASING A PHONE WITH LESS THAN 1GB OF RAM AND I WAS REGRETTING IT AT THIS POINT. IT WOULD FREEZE AND STUTTER DURING EVEN THE SIMPLEST TASKS SUCH AS HAMMERING OUT A TEXT. I PUT FORTH MY BEST EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE MY SYSTEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT RUNNING SMOOTHLY BUT THE FACT WAS IT JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RAM TO POWER ANDROID COMFORTABLY. I WAS READY TO DITCH THE PHONE FOR SOMETHING NEW.I HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED MY TUNE, HOWEVER, AND WOULDN'T HESITATE TO RECOMMEND THIS PHONE IN A HEARTBEAT. WHY? SURPRISINGLY, LANDVO HAS SUPPORTED WITH RELEASING AN OFFICIAL 4.4 KITKAT ROM FOR THE PHONE. FOR THOSE WHO ARE TECH SAVVY, THIS IS A BOON. KITKAT WAS ACTUALLY STREAMLINED BY GOOGLE SO THAT DEVICES WITH ONLY 512MB OF RAM CAN RUN IT COMFORTABLY (4.2 WAS A BIT OF A RESOURCE HOG). AT THIS POINT, I FIGURED I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE--I WAS PLANNING ON DUMPING THE PHONE ANYWAYS. NEEDLESS TO SAY, FLASHING TO KITKAT MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. THE PERFORMANCE IS LITERALLY NIGHT AND DAY AS UPGRADING TO 4.4 LITERALLY GOT RID OF *ALL* THE LAG I WAS EXPERIENCING WITH THE PHONE. IT IS NOW QUITE FAST--I WOULD ARGUE FASTER THAN MY SERO 7 PRO TABLET WHICH IS RUNNING THE OLD BUT VENERABLE TEGRA 3 PROCESSOR. DEMANDING, APPS LOAD QUICKLY WITHOUT STUTTERING. ANIMATIONS ARE SMOOTH AND EVERYTHING HAS BECOME A JOY TO USE WITH THIS PHONE.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP, BUT FAST 5.0"" ANDROID PHONE WITH GOOD BATTERY LIFE AND GOOD BUILD QUALITY, THIS IS THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HANDS DOWN. IT'S NOT GOING TO COMPETE WITH TOTL PHONES OUT THERE BUT FOR A MEASLY $95, YOU SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTING THAT. WHAT YOU GET IS A PERFECTLY USABLE PHONE AT AN ALMOST THROW AWAY PRICE. I'VE NOTICED VENDORS SELLING THE L800 WITH ANDROID 4.4 ALREADY INSTALLED SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE NEW STOCK OF THIS PHONE HAS BEEN UPGRADED. IF YOU ARE NOT TECH SAVVY AND COMFORTABLE WITH FLASHING YOUR PHONE, MAKE SURE YOU PURCHASE ONE WITH 4.4 ALREADY INSTALLED! YOU WILL LOVE IT IF YOU DO."
IS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT I RECOMENDED IT HAS ALL YOU WILL NEED, IT'S FAST GOOD LOOKING VERY GOOD,THANK YOU
MY AUTISTIC SON IS IN HIS GLORY LOL THANK YOU AGAIN
ALL AROUND GOOD PHONE, NOT GLITCHY AT ALL, OR LAGGY. THERE ARE A FEE PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE STORAGE BEING VERY SMALL (ONLY 2GB) AND THE CAMERA IS VERY POOR QUALITY. I'M PRETTY CERTAIN THAT YOU CAN BUY A GALAXY S 4 CAMERA AND INSTALL IT TO THIS PHONE. BUT ALL AROUND THIS IS A PRETTY GREAT PHONE!
I HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING THE PHONE TO STRAIGHT TALK.THE PHONE CAME IN ABOUT 3WEEKS. THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE CAMERA ITS HORRIBLE WHEN TRYING TO GET A TAKE PICTURE THE PICTURES WASN'T CLEAR
DELIVERY WAS FAST. THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE PHONE IS JUST LIKE THE PRICE VERY CHEAP. NOT A GOOD QUALITY CAMERA SO THAT IS ONE FEATURE I DO NOT USE AT ALL AND ALSO NOT VERY DURABLE MY SCREEN WAS DAMAGED FROM A 3 INCH DROP. HOWEVER I DO SUPPOSE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR BUT AFTER ONLY HAVING IT FOR A MONTH I AM VERY WILLING TO JUST BUY A REAL PHONE AND LOSE THIS TERRIBLE ONE.
PERFECT
WORKED OK FOR AWHILE NOW EVERY TIME I TAP THE BACK IT SHUTS OFF
GREAT PHONE. MY SONE HAS BEEN HAPPY WITH IT. NEEDED TO GET AN EXTRA MICRO-SD CARD FOR MORE STORAGE.
VALID FOR MOVILNET IN VENEZUELA, LOW MEMORY, BAD CAMERA, LOW PRICE, GREAT!!
VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT
WHEN I FIRST GOT THE PHONE IT HAD A VERY POOR CAMERA AND ONE DAY I HIT MY PHONE WITH A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OFF IMMEDIATELY. I DO NOT LIKE THE PHONE WHATSOEVER. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS PHONE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE TO TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES OR USE A LOT OF APPS. THE STORAGE IS ALSO VERY POOR.
CHEAP AND FAST
THE PHONE WORKS GREAT BUT MY CHARGER OUTLET ON PHONE IS HAVING TO BE FIXED AND THE ONE THEY SENT FALLS OUT AND MY PHONE DOESNT CHARGE WITH IT. IT WILL COST 55 DOLLARS TO HAVE CHARGER FIXED BEFORE IT MESSES THE MOTHERBOARD UP. THATS ALMOST AS MUCH AS PHONE
VERY GOOD CELL
VERY RESPONSIBLE SELLER AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT
MUY BUENO
FINO FINO
EXELENTES EQUIPOS EN LENGUAJE CRIOLLO SON UNA VERDADERAS NAVES
GOOD
ITS GREAT FOR THE PRICE BUT I HATE HOW YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE LOCK SCREEN TO WHAT YOU WANTAND JUST HAS THE DEFAULT WALLPAPERS FOR YOUR LOCKSCREEN
WHEN I GOT NEW PHONE. I LOVED THIS PHONE. BUT WITH ANDROID 4.2.2 IT VERY SMALL LIMITED AND WOULD NOT LET YOU SET IN SD CARD WHERE YOU WANT IT. SO MAY HAVE TO UPGRADE NEW ANDROID 4.4 I HEARD THEY WORK BETTER. I HAVE NOT FIGURE OUT WITH MY. AS I USING STRAIGHT TALK I HAVE NO PROBLEM SETTING IN STRAIGHT TALK APN SETTING. SO FAR I WANT TO FIND BETTER PROTECTION CASE FOR THIS. I HAVE NOT FOUND WHAT I LIKE. HOPEFULLY THEY DO MAKE ONE FOR THIS PHONE.
I LIKE THE FM RADIO FEATURE AND CHARGE CRADLE, BUT I SWITCHED BACK TO A LG 450 FLIP PHONE THAT COST $20 LESS FROM BEST BUYRECEPTION IN WEAK SIGNAL AREAS NOT AS GOOD AS THE LG 450. PHONE WAS ON T-MOBILE NETWORKBACKLIGHTING UNEVEN ON KEYPAD. THE NUMBER 9 IS REALLY BRIGHT ON MY PHONE.USER MANUAL IS TOO SMALL FOR A PHONE DESIGNED FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THE MANUAL IS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE PHONE, SO IT FITS IN A SMALL BOX FOR SHIPPING. MANUAL DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE USE OF EACH BUTTON IN A CLEAR CONCISE WAY.I COULDN'T GET THE ALARM TO REPEAT DAILY. TURNING ALARM OFF WOULD CANCEL ALARM FOR NEXT DAY.
I BOUHT THIS PHONE FOR MY 82 YEAR OLD MOTHER WHO HAS MACULAR DEGENERATION, SHE LOVES IT. IT IS VERY EASY AND SHE CAN SEE THE BIG NUMBERS FOR DIALING AND SUCH.
LIKE YOUR AD...LOVE IT!
THE CHARGER DID NOT WORK. MY PARENTS STARTED USING THE CABLE DIRECTLY TO THE PHONE
HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAS ZERO INTEREST IN LEARNING ANYTHING TECH. YEARS AGO GAVE HER AN OLD T-MOBILE PRE PAID FLIP PHONE. I HAD KEPT IT FOR YEARS AS A BACKUP PHONE. TO HER IT WAS PERFECT. SHE DID NOT WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING ELSE. PROBLEM WAS THE PHONE AND BUTTONS WERE VERY SMALL AND GETTING HARD FOR HER. ORDERED THIS AND PUT HER SIM IN IT AND AWAY IT WENT. SHE LOVES IT. IT WILL DO A LOT OF EXTRA STUFF IF SHE EVER DECIDES SHE WANTS TO LEARN. FOR NOW SHE LOVES HOW MUCH LARGER THE BUTTONS ARE. JUST DEAD SIMPLE TO USE WHICH IS ALL SHE WANTS.
GOOD QUALITY PHONE
DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH T-MOBILE. T-MOBILE CLOSES OFF SOME TOWERS TO NON-T-MOBILE PHONES.
SCREEN SIZE IS GOOD AND EASY TO READ. SOUND COULD BE A LITTLE LOUDER BUT IS OKAY. SETTINGS ARE A LITTLE CRYPTIC BUT GET THE JOB DONE WITH A FEW EXTRA KEY STOKES THAN REALLY NEEDED. I DON'T CARE FOR THE WAY THEY SETUP THE TEXTING WHERE YOU HAVE TO HIT A BUTTON TWICE TO GET A CAPITAL LETTER THEN HIT IT AGAIN TO TURN OFF CAPITALS. MY OTHER BRAND PHONE AUTOMATICALLY CAPITALIZED THE FIRST LETTER AFTER A PERIOD BUT THIS ONE DOES NOT. STILL A GOOD PHONE THOUGH AND WORTH THE MONEY.
THIS IS LIKE THE 5TH CELLPHONE FOR MY DAD IN LESS THAN A YEAR. MY DAD ALWAYS DOES ALL TYPE OF HEAVY LABOUR WORK AND IN THE PROCESS HE ALWAYS ENDS UP DESTROYING IT IN THE PROCESS. WELL MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS AS I RECIEVED THE CELLPHONE IN THE MAIL IS THE KEYPAD. I REALLY LIKE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE HUGE AND ALSO THE DISPLAY IS QUITE CLEAR AND CRISPY AND SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND. HE HAD NO PROBLEM ADJUSTING TO THIS NEW DEVICE.IT HAS A FM RADIO WHICH DOES NOT NEED HEADPHONES TO WORK IT HAS A CAMERA WHICH IS OK NOT THE BEST BUT PLAUSIBLE. IT HAS AN SD SLOT FOR MEDIA. BUT IT CANNOT PLAY MUSIC NOR THE VIDEOS FILES THEY DONT SHOW UP WHEN I TRY SEARCH THE FOLDERS IN THE MEMORY. I LIKE THAT IT HAS AN LED LIGHT TO ALERT HIM OF ANY NOTIFICATIONS WHICH IS A PLUS AND THE RINGTONES ARE PRETTY LOUD TOO. GOOD PICK FOR AGING PARENTS.
THIS IS A REALLY GREAT PHONE. I AM VISUALLY IMPAIRED AND HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT. WILL BE GETTING ANOTHER ONE FOR MY PARTNER.
MORE COMPLICATED THAN I EXPECTED. TERRIBLE RECEPTION. TOO HARD FOR MY MOM TO USE. JUST FRUSTRATES HER.
NO INTERNET
PHONE RECEPTION POOR WITH INCOMING CALLS
NICE PHONE. EASY TO READ SCREEN. I AM A SENIOR AND NOT A TECH SO THE LEARNING CURVE WAS STEEP. THE SUPPORT AT JETHRO, HOWEVER, MADE IT EASY. THEY WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, PATIENT, AND SO WILLING TO HELP THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE PHONE BECAUSE OF THEM. THE SOS BUTTON IS A GOOD FEATURE AND WITH MY LIMITED USE AS A TELEPHONE IT IS A MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TOOL THAN A LIFE LINE..
THE SLEEK DESIGN AND EASY OF USE IS WHAT MAKES THIS PHONE REALLY GOOD. THE LARGE TEXT IS A PLUS
MY HUSBAND LOVES IT!! IT IS SIMPLE TO USE WITH LARGE NUMBERS. THE SIMPLER THE BETTER FOR HIM.
THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT A 3 STAR IS BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE HARD FOR A ELDER PERSON TO USE.
EVEN THE INSTRUCTION BOOK IS BETTER THAN ANY I HAVE EVER HAD, BUT AS A SENIOR WE NEED BIG PRINT WITH THE PHONE, NOT FOR YOUR WEBSITE AS PAGE 1 CLEARLY TELLS US BECAUSE SENIORS TAKE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THEM AS WE GO PLACES, ESPECIALLY TRAVELING AND THERE IS NOT A COMPUTER READILY AT HAND, REMEMBER WE ARE NOT THE LAPTOP GENERATION, JUST GETTING INTO TABLETS AND THEY ARE OFTEN TO SMALL. OTHERWISE, SO FAR SO GREAT. LOVE THE NAME, I ASK MY BROTHER, DO YOU HAVE JETHRO, WHEN HE IS LEAVING.
THIS PHONE WAS PURCHASED FOR MY FATHER. I REALLY LIKE THE FEATURES AND FOR THE PRICE IT IS AN EXCELLENT DEAL. IT TOOK ME EXACTLY 1 MONTH TO GET EVERYTHING WORKING ON THE PHONE BUT THE ISSUE WAS NOT THE PHONE IT WAS ME (MY FIRST UNLOCKED PHONE) AND CONSUMER CELLULAR. THE MANUAL THAT CAME WITH THE PHONE IS NOT THAT GOOD AND SOME THINGS IN THE MANUAL DO NOT MATCH THE PHONE.I RECEIVED A LOT OF HELP FROM JETHRO. JEFFREY FROM JETHRO IS A GODSEND. HE WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND ALWAYS HAD A CHEERFUL VOICE. HE CALLED ME, HE SENT ME PICTURES, ETC. HE DID WHATEVER IT TOOK TO HELP ME WITH MY ISSUES EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUS THE PROBLEM WAS NOT ON JETHRO'S END.I REALLY LIKE THE PHONE BUT THE 5 STARS ARE FOR JEFFREY. I HOPE JETHRO REALIZES WHAT A GREAT EMPLOYEE THEY HAVE IN HIM.
WORKS GOOD FOR 3G AND ABOVE. SIMPLE TO USE. NO FRILLS.
SIMPLE. SLEEK. MINIMALIST. ACCEPTS ANY SIM. THE PERFECT BACK-UP PHONE. NICE MATTE FINISH. PRETTY EMERALD GREEN NOTIFICATION LIGHT. A FEW COOL ALARMS/RINGTONES.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED:- VERY LIMITED SPACE FOR MESSAGES. WILL STOP ACCEPTING TXTS AFTER ABOUT 30. EVEN ADDING AN SD CARD DIDN'T HELP, SO IT WASN'T PROGRAMMED TO UTILIZE IT FOR MESSAGES.- CAMERA WORSE THAN SECURITY FOOTAGE. WHY EVEN BOTHER?- MENU STRUCTURE NOT INTUITIVE.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE UNDER WATER. IT SHUTS OFF WHILE YOU ARE ON CALL.
I WAS CONTACTING JETHRO CUSTOMER SERVICE, BECAUSE A COUPLE OF KEYS WERE STICKING. AS I WAS SPEAKING THE REP NOTICED I WAS BREAKING UP TO MUCH, SO HE TOLD ME THE PHONE WAS A 2G..AND MOST LIKELY DID NOT WORK WELL IN MY AREA. SO HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SEND BE A 3.5G PHONE MODEL SC-628..THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE...SO FAR BUT I MUST SAY IT WAS THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE RESPONSE TO SOLVE THE ISSUE....
"[NEW EDITION] JETHRO [SC213V2] FLIP QUAD-BAND UNLOCKED GSM SENIOR & KIDS CELL PHONE, SOS EMERGENCY BUTTON, 2.4"" LARGE LCD WITH LARGE KEYPAD.A A NICE PHONE, EASY TO OPERATE AND COST FRIENDLY. ITS ALSO LIGHT AND SO EASILY PORTABLE. YOU CAN USE YOUR MICRO SIM AND SAVE YOUR MUSIC AND PHOTOS."
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THE OLD SIM CARD TO WORK WITH IT, BUT VERIZON HOOKED ME UP
GOOD PHONE FOR MY 82 YEAR OLD DAD WHO WANTED A CAMERA, BUT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH AN IPHONE. NEEDS A MEMORY CARD FOR THE CAMERA TO WORK THOUGH. IT'S NICE YOU CAN SET SPEED DIALS.
BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY ABLE TO WORK WITH STRAIGHTTALK OR TRACFONE. WE PUT A TRACFONE SIM CARD ON BOARD, BOUGHT A 30 BUCK STRAIGHTTALK MINUTES CARD, THEN DISCOVERED IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH STRAIGHTTALK AND THER LOCAL WALLY WORLD WANTS AT LEAST 60 BUCKS FOR A SIM CARD KIT THAT WILL WORK--SUPPOSEDLY. MY DAUGHTER WORKED WITH IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND CALLED EVERY AVAILABLE NUMBER. NO GOOD. SHE IS EXPERT WITH TODAY'S HIGH TECH. THE CHEAPER TRACFONE CARD IS AVAILABLE, AND I'LL ASK MY DAUGHTER TO TAKE ANOTHER TRY WHEN SHE HAS TIME, BUT SHE HAS HER OWN JOB AND FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF. AS ANOTHER POINT, THE ONLY WAY THE MANUAL IS OF ANY USE AT ALL IS TO DOWNLOAD IT AS A PDF AND PRINT THE REGULAR PAGES. OTHERWISE, IT'S +3 READERS AND A 3 STRENGTH MAGNIFYING GLASS. NO, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, BUT MOST PARTICULARLY NOT FOR OTHER ELDERLY PEOPLE (I'M READY TO TURN 78).
MET EXPECTATIONS, EASY TO USE, GAVE AS GIFT VETO ELDERLY RELATIVE. SHE LOVES IT.
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY 91 YEAR OLD AUNT. IT SEEMS VERY EASY FOR TO USE. WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT. PURCHASED ANOTHER BRAND SENIOR PHONE SAME PRICE THAT DIDN'T LAST 2 WEEKS DUE TO QUALITY OF PHONE SCREEN
I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT.
GOOD PHONE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE.
BOUGHT FOR MY MOM! SHE LOVES IT!
I SEARCHED FOR UNLOCKED FLIP PHONES 3D BECAUSE MY OLD T-MOBIL NO LONGER WORKS IN MY HOUSE.THIS LOOKS GOOD BUT THE ONLY 3D CAPABILITY IS IN ITS SECOND MINISIM.I NEED SIMPLICITY - I HAVE A HUSBAND THAT CAN BARELY ANSWER A FLIP PHONE LET ALONE USE THIS AND I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BUY A MINI SIM.I BELIEVE THIS WAS BADLY DESCRIBED. THE MANUAL IS IN BAD ENGLISH AND SEEMS TO BE FOR A DIFFERENT PHONE.
NOT AS SENSITIVE AS OUR TRACK PHONE, BUT THE JETHRO IS EASIER TO READ .
I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. FIRST OF ALL I PAID TO HAVE IT SHIPPED TO ME AND THEN ONCE I RECEIVED IT I FOUND OUT FROM STAIGHT TALK THAT AFTER 1/1/2017 THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER WORK WITH ATT WHICH IS THE ONLY CELL PHONE CARRIER THAT IS MY AREA. I WAS ABLE TO SEND IT BACK BUT I HAVE TO PAY THE POSTAGE. I AM NOT HAPPY. KEN
"I AM A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I NEVER MADE THE TRANSITION TO SMARTPHONE, MAINLY BECAUSE I SIT IN FROM OF A COMPUTER EVERYDAY ANYWAY. IF I NEED ACCESS TO ALL THOSE SMARTPHONE APPS, I JUST USE MY LAPTOP! BESIDES, THE SCREENS ARE TINY AND I AM FARSIGHTED, SO THAT MEANS IF I USE A SMARTPHONE, I AM GOING TO HAVE TO CARRY EVEN MORE ITEMS: READING GLASSES.BUT I AM AN ADVENTUROUS TYPE, BIKING, MOTORCYCLING, HANG GLIDING, SCUBA, ETC. AND COULD FIND MYSELF IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE DURING ONE OF THESE RISKY ADVENTURES. AND I DO LIVE ALONE AND MIGHT NEED TO GET HELP IN A CAR BREAKDOWN OR A HOME INJURY SITUATION. SO I BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE PRE-PAID CELLS AND THOUGHT, THERE YOU GO THAT'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED. NO IT WASN'T. I KEPT POCKET DIALING. I COULDN'T SEE THE SCREEN EITHER. BUT WORSE THING WAS THE BATTERY WOULD GO DEAD ON ME EVERY FEW DAYS. SINCE I NEVER USED THE CELL PHONE EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCIES, I WOULD ALWAYS ALWAYS FORGET TO CHARGE IT. SO A PREPAID DIDN'T WORK AS MY EMERGENCY PHONE.JETHRO SOLVED THE PROBLEM. IT IS A BIG SCREEN CLAMSHELL THAT IS ABOUT AS INEXPENSIVE AS A PRE-PAID, BUT SOOOO MUCH MORE USEFUL. BECAUSE IT IS A CLAMSHELL, I GET NO MORE POCKET DIALING. BECAUSE IT IS A BIG SCREEN, I DON'T HAVE TO CARRY READING GLASSES AROUND. I AM ACTUALLY USING IT A LITTLE FOR TAKING TODO NOTES AND USING THE CALCULATOR, AS WELL AS ITS GREAT FM RADIO AND FLASHLIGHT. AND ITS BATTERY LASTS MORE THAN A WEEK IN STANDBY MODE! HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T USED IT YET FOR A REAL EMERGENCY PHONE CALL YET (BUT I PLACED SEVERAL TEST CALLS - WORKS GREAT) , BUT JETHRO TOOK MY PRE-PAID T-MOBILE SIM WITH NO PROBLEMS AND I WAS UP AND RUNNING IN A FEW MINUTES.SO IF YOU NEED A CELLPHONE YOU CAN THROW IN YOUR BACKPACK OR GLOVE BOX IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, THIS IS IT. PLUS IT IS INEXPENSIVE, SO IF YOU BREAK OR LOSE IT, THEN ""NO BIGGIE""."
FAST SHIPPING, AND ACCURATE DESCRIPTION
THE PHONE IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN SIGNAL AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USAGE ON THE TMOBILE NETWORK. I HOPE IT IS A DEFECTED PRODUCT
GREAT PHONE.
SHORTLY AFTER RETURN WINDOW CLOSED, STOPPED TAKING A CHARGE AND WILL NOT TURN ON.
STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 MONTHS. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE.
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I HAVE PLACED MY T-MOBILE SIM CARD IN THE PHONE BUT IT WILL NOT READ IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS PHONE.
SOUND QUALITY POOR, NO SPEAKER PHONE
GREAT PHONE!
EXCELENTE
THIS PHONE MET ALL OUR EXPECTATIONS, MY DAD LOVED IT AND IS ENJOYING IT!
THIS MAY BE AN ISSUE OF EXPECTATION MISMATCH. FOR ONE THING, THE PHONE IS MUCH SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED. SOME MIGHT THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING. BUT FOR MANY ELDERLY AND HEARING AID EQUIPPED PEOPLE, IT WOULD WORK BETTER IF THE PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS WERE LARGER. SECONDLY, THE TIME TO HOLD THE RED BUTTON FOR TURNING THE PHONE OFF IS TOO SHORT. MY 90 YEAR OLD MOTHER IN LAW OFTEN TURNS THE PHONE OFF WHEN SHE IS HANGING UP.THAT BEING SAID, THE PHONE WORKS FINE. THE BUTTONS AND NUMBERS ARE LARGE.
I BOUGHT IT FOR MY ELDERLY GRANDFATHER WHICH IS VERY VOCAL ABOUT EVERYTHING WE GET HIM WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. HE LIKES THE PHONE IT'S LOUD AND IT'S SIMPLE. HE DOESN'T NEED HIS GLASSES TO USE IT. I WAS ABLE TO SYNC IT WITH AT&T
JUST WHAT WE NEEDED FOR AN OLDER RELATIVE.
IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDMA IN SOUTH AMERICA AND SHE LOVED IT THANKS!
THE SPEAKERS ARE GARBAGE AND IT ONLY TELLS TIME IN MILITARY TIME
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY ELDERLY PARENT. HE HAS AT&T, I DID PUT THE SIM CARD FROM HIS AT&T PHONE IN THE JETHRO, IT WORKED. THE ONLY PROBLEM HE WAS HAVING WAS DROPPED CALLS. HE WOULD RECEIVE OR MAKE A PHONE CALL AND THE PHONE WOULD HANG UP ON THE PERSON ON THE OTHER LINE. I'M ASKING FOR A REFUND. IT WASN'T HIS CARRIER, IT'S THE PHONE. HE HAD 3 OR 4 BARS WHEN THE PHONE CALLS TOOK PLACE.
THIS IS A GREAT, SIMPLE PHONE WHICH IS GETTING TO BE HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND. FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT A SMARTPHONE AND JUST NEED A PHONE FOR AN ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBER OR FOR SOMEONE WHO IS NOT TECH SAVVY, THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE PHONE. I GAVE IT FOUR STARS, THOUGH BECAUSE OUR CARRIER - AT&T - DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SIGNATURE OF THIS PHONE, SO WE WOUND UP HAVING TO BUY AN AT&T FRIENDLY PHONE. THE PHONE WORKS, BUT WHEN WE ARE BILLED THEIR SYSTEM WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE THIS AS A SMARTPHONE - WHICH IS AN EXTRA $40 ON OUR BILL - SINCE IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE SIGNATURE :/ WE WILL BE GIVING IT TO THE MILITARY TO REUSE.
MY GRANNY COULDN'T USE THE PHONE BECAUSE SHE WASN'T ABLE TO USE THE LOCKING THE PHONE FUNCTION, AND WITHOUT THE LOCK THE PHONE CALLED PEOPLE WHEN THE PHONE WAS IN HER POCKET. IF THE LOCK WAS EASIER FOR HER, THEN THIS PHONE WOULD BE GREAT.
NOT GOOD SOUND, NOT EASILY USED BY SENIOR, END BUTTON IS ALSO TURN OFF BUTTON...SO MY ELDERLY MOM KEEPS TURNING OFF THE PHONE!WILL HAVE TO FIND HER ANOTHER ONE..,WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS AGAIN.THE PURCHASE AND DELIVERY WERE AS SCHEDULED.
REALLY SURPRISED BY THIS PHONE, WITH FM RADIO AND A FLASHLIGHT AND THE SOS FEATURE IS NICE AS WELL FOR MY MOM
NICE BIG NUMBERS EVERYWHERE! SIMPLE TOO!
